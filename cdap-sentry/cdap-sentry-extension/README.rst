================================================
CDAP Authorization Extension using Apache Sentry
================================================

Overview
========

This project integrates CDAP with Apache Sentry to delegate authorization (both ACL Management and Enforcement) to
Apache Sentry. It implements the CDAP
`Authorizer <https://github.com/caskdata/cdap/blob/develop/cdap-security/src/main/java/co/cask/cdap/security/authorization/Authorizer.java>`_
interface to achieve this integration. This project is implemented as a CDAP Authorizer extension.

Code Organization
=================

This code is organized into three submodules:

CDAP Sentry Model
-----------------

Defines the CDAP Data Model in Sentry. Used in both the Sentry Service and the Sentry Client (which runs inside the
CDAP Master).

CDAP Sentry Policy Engine
-------------------------

Defines authorization policies for CDAP entities in Sentry. It depends on the CDAP Sentry Model. It runs inside the
Sentry Service and is not required in the Sentry Client.

CDAP Sentry Binding
-------------------

Defines binding between the CDAP entities and the CDAP Data Model in the Sentry Service. Runs inside the Sentry Client
which runs inside the CDAP Master.

Building
========

Prerequisites
-------------
Since Apache Sentry releases are source-only, this project assumes that Apache Sentry 1.7.0 has been pre-built and
installed in the local maven repo. To do this, in the Apache Sentry source root directory please run::

  git fetch origin
  git checkout branch-1.7.0
  mvn clean install -DskipTests


To build the CDAP Sentry Extension and run tests, execute the following command from the ``cdap-sentry``
root directory::

  mvn clean package


To skip tests, execute::

   mvn clean package -DskipTests


Deploying
=========

Sentry Server Side Deployment
-----------------------------

The server side code only requires CDAP Sentry Policy and the CDAP Sentry Model classes. So, the
``cdap-sentry-extension/cdap-sentry-policy/target/cdap-sentry-policy-*.jar`` and
``cdap-sentry-extension/cdap-sentry-model/target/cdap-sentry-model-*.jar``
should be deployed on the host running the Sentry Service. There are two options for deploying these jars:

1. Copy them to the ``[SENTRY_HOME_DIR]/lib`` directory; or
2. Set ``HADOOP_CLASSPATH`` to the location containing these jar files. On a
   `Cloudera Manager <https://www.cloudera.com/products/cloudera-manager.html>`__ managed cluster, the
   ``HADOOP_CLASSPATH`` can be set under the **Sentry Service Environment Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve)**
   configuration setting for the Sentry Service.

Additionally, the following configurations should be specified in the ``sentry-site.xml`` used by the Sentry Service:

1. The ``cdap`` user should be added to ``sentry.service.allow.connect``.
2. The ``cdap`` user should be added to ``sentry.service.admin.group``.
3. An additional setting ``sentry.cdap.action.factory`` should be set to
   ``co.cask.cdap.security.authorization.sentry.model.ActionFactory``. This setting can be added as a
   **Sentry Service Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) for sentry-site.xml**

After updating these jars and settings, please restart the Sentry Service.

CDAP Master side deployment
---------------------------
The CDAP Master, which is also a client for the Sentry service requires the CDAP Sentry Binding classes as well as its    dependencies. To deploy the cdap-sentry authorization extension:

- Install the ``cdap-sentry-binding/target/cdap-sentry-binding-*.jar`` at a known location on your CDAP Master host.
- Set the following properties in in the ``cdap-site.xml`` that the Master uses:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Value
   * - ``security.authorization.extension.jar.path``
     - Absolute path of the ``cdap-sentry-binding-*.jar`` on the local file system of the CDAP Master.
   * - ``security.authorization.extension.config.sentry.site.url``
     - Absolute path of the client-side ``sentry-site.xml`` on the local file system of the CDAP Master. Note, if
       Apache Sentry is managed via Cloudera Manager, you can download this file from the Actions -> Download Client
       Configuration drop down link in the "Configuration" tab of the Sentry Service.
   * - ``security.authorization.extension.config.sentry.admin.group``
     - A unix group configured as an admin group in the Sentry Service (identified by ``sentry.service.admin.group``
       in the ``sentry-site.xml`` used by the Sentry Service). This group is used while granting ``ALL`` privileges
       to a user when he/she successfully creates an entity, as well as revoking privileges when an entity is deleted.
       This is an optional setting. If unspecified, these convenience operations (granting privileges upon entity
       creation and revoking them upon entity deletion) will not be performed. In that case, Sentry admins will be
       responsible for granting privileges to roles in Sentry after successful creation of entities in CDAP, as well as
       for revoking those privileges when entities are deleted.
   * - ``security.authorization.extension.config.superusers``
     - Comma-separated list of super users. Super users are authorized to perform all operations on all entities.
       They can also manage roles.
   * - ``security.authorization.authorizer.extension.config.instance.name``
     - String to use to identify the CDAP Instance. Defaults to 'cdap'.

- Restart CDAP Master.
